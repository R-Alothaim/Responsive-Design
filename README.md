In this Responsive Web Design Website, you'll learn the languages that developers use to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design and you'll learn how to make webpages that respond to different screen sizes.

<h1>The normailze.css files</h1>
You will also notice all the project foldes includes a normalize.css file.

Scrimba includes this by default, behind the scenes. You'll want to leave this in each project file, and keep the link in the HTML file. By default, Scrimba places them in the root folder. If you'd prefer to stay organized, feel free to move it to the CSS folder, but ensure that you also update the path in all the HTML files if you do this :).
